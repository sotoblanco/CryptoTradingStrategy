# Divergence strategy

To test this trading strategy we use two indicators RSI and Aroon values to help us indentify a divergency between the price and the RSI

# RSI
Investopedia definition: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp#:~:text=The%20relative%20strength%20index%20(RSI)%20is%20a%20momentum%20indicator%20used,a%20stock%20or%20other%20asset.&text=An%20RSI%20reading%20of%2030,an%20oversold%20or%20undervalued%20condition.

The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. The indicator was originally developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, “New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.”

Traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI are that values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.

# Aroon
Investopedia definition: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aroon.asp#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Aroon%20Indicator,lows%20over%20a%20time%20period

The Aroon indicator is a technical indicator that is used to identify trend changes in the price of an asset, as well as the strength of that trend. In essence, the indicator measures the time between highs and the time between lows over a time period. The idea is that strong uptrends will regularly see new highs, and strong downtrends will regularly see new lows. The indicator signals when this is happening, and when it isn't.

The indicator consists of the "Aroon up" line, which measures the strength of the uptrend, and the "Aroon down" line, which measures the strength of the downtrend.


The buy and sell signal is the classical approach of the technical analysis optimization of the paremeters can improve the performance of this trading strategy build for educational purpose
## Buy signal

If the difference between the Aroon High price value and the RSI Aroon value is greater than 75 buy the currency given that is an indicator of a uptred

## Sell signal

If the difference between the Aroon Low price value and the RSI Aroon value is greater than 75 sell the currency
